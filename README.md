#LET'S CALCULATE PI

Any precision and any method is valid, just try not to use trigonometric functions. There are very efficient ways with using a little complex algebra, like the Leibniz formula or Arctan method (Machin)... if you are able to deduct and explain them go ahead, but the idea is to use algorithms we can all understand.

In pimachin.html you will find the arctan method. It can be useful to look at if you to deal with many decimals of precision.

FYI: The equation that defines a circumference is x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = R<sup>2</sup>
